Installation
------------
Quipucords is delivered via a RPM command line tool and a server container image. Below you will find instructions for installing each of these items.

Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^
qpc, the command line tool installed by RPM, is available for `download <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/chambridge/qpc/>`_ from fedora COPR.

1. First, make sure that the EPEL repo is enabled for the server.
You can find the appropriate architecture and version on the `EPEL wiki <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7::
 rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6::
 rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm

2. Next, add the COPR repo to your server.
You can find the appropriate architecture and version on the `COPR qpc page <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/chambridge/qpc/>`_.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7::
 wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/chambridge-qpc-epel-7.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/chambridge/qpc/repo/epel-7/chambridge-qpc-epel-7.repo

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6::
 wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/chambridge-qpc-epel-6.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/chambridge/qpc/repo/epel-6/chambridge-qpc-epel-6.repo

3. Then, install the qpc beta package (Note the package version below is a placeholder until the beta build is ready).

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7::
  yum -y install qpc-0.0.1-1.git.227.d622e53.el7.centos

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6::
  yum -y install qpc-0.0.1-1.git.227.d622e53.el6


Preparing for Server Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Quipucords server is delivered as a container image that will be run on your server. First you must install the necessary dependency, Docker, in order to run the container.

Installing Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To run Docker on Red Hat-6.6 or later, you need kernel 2.6.32-431 or higher.

To check your current kernel version, open a terminal and use uname -r to display your kernel version::
  $ uname -r
  3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64

Finally, is it recommended that you fully update your system. Please keep in mind that your system should be fully patched to fix any potential kernel bugs. Any reported kernel bugs may have already been fixed on the latest kernel packages

If your system meets the minimum required kernel version you can proceed with the install of Docker with the following steps:

1. Log into your machine as a user with ``sudo`` or ``root`` privileges.


2. Download the Docker RPM to the current directory::

  $ curl -O -sSL https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/6/Packages/docker-engine-1.7.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

3. Use yum to install the package::

  $ sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck docker-engine-1.7.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

4. Start the Docker daemon::

  $ sudo service docker start

5. Verify that docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.::

  $ sudo docker run hello-world
  Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
  latest: Pulling from hello-world
  a8219747be10: Pull complete
  91c95931e552: Already exists
  hello-world:latest: The image you are pulling has been verified. Important: image verification is a tech preview feature and should not be relied on to provide security.
  Digest: sha256:aa03e5d0d5553b4c3473e89c8619cf79df368babd18681cf5daeb82aab55838d
  Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
  Hello from Docker.
  This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


  To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
   1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
   2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
          (Assuming it was not already locally available.)
   3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
          executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
   4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
          to your terminal.


  To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
   $ docker run -it ubuntu bash


  For more examples and ideas, visit:
   http://docs.docker.com/userguide/

6. To ensure Docker starts when you boot your system, do the following::

  $ sudo chkconfig docker on


Installing Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
You can install Docker in different ways, depending on your needs:

- Most users set up Dockerâ€™s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach.

- Some users download the RPM package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.

**Install using the repository**

1. Log into your machine as a user with ``sudo`` or ``root`` privileges.

2. Install required packages::

  $ sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

3. Add repository::

  $ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

4. Install docker from repository::

  $ sudo yum install docker-ce

**Install from a package**

1. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/ and download the .rpm file for the Docker version you want to install and place it on the intended install system.

2. Log into your machine as a user with ``sudo`` or ``root`` privileges.

3. Install Docker, changing the path below to the path where you downloaded the Docker package::

  $ sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm

**Start Docker**

Now that Docker has been installed on the system perform the following steps to get running.

1. Start Docker::

  $ sudo systemctl start docker

2. Verify that docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image::

  $ sudo docker run hello-world


Obtaining the Server Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that Docker has been installed we can obtain the container image that will enable the use of the Quipucords server.

**TBD**


Configuration
-------------

Running the Quipucords Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the Quipucords container image now available on your system's image registry we can start the server.

There are several configurable options that must be considered:

- Exposed server port
- Selecting a directory for SSH keys
- Selecting a directory for the SQLlite database
- Selecting a directory for log output


The server exposes port 443, which is the standard HTTPS port. You may choose to utilize that port or re-map the port on your server.

If you selected to expose port 443 then you would use the following option when running the image ``-p443:443``. If you wish to re-map the port on your system Docker's mapping is -p<host_port>:<container_port>. If you choose for example to re-map the port to 8443 the option to supply would be ``-p8443:443``. Additionally, Docker supplies an option to select a free port for all exposed ports by using the ``-P`` option; the port mapping is then available from the ``docker ps`` command.


For the next three configuration options we will take a simple setup strategy for the Quipucords server and create a "home directory" for the server.

1. Create the home directory ``/opt/quipucords``::

  mkdir -p /opt/quipucords

2. Change to that directory::

  cd /opt/quipucords

3. Create directories to house the SSH keys (``/opt/quipucords/sshkeys``), database (``/opt/quipucords/data``), and log output (``/opt/quipucords/log``)::

  mkdir sshkeys
  mkdir data
  mkdir log


Following these steps we can now launch the Quipucords server with the following docker command::

  docker run --name quipucords -d -p443:443 -v /opt/quipucords/sshkeys:/sshkeys -v /opt/quipucords/data:/var/data -v /opt/quipucords/log:/var/log -i quipucords:latest

The above command starts the server running on port ``443`` mapping the server's directories to the home directory we just created. You can view the status of the running server with ``docker ps``.

Verify the server is responding correctly by launching a browser to **https://<ip_address>:<port>/admin**. If your browser is on the same system as the server and you exposed port ``443`` the URL would be **https://localhost/admin**. When your browser loads you should see the administrative login dialog. From here you can log into the server and change the default password. The server comes defaulted with a user **admin** and password **pass**. You should find the "Change Password" selection in the upper right navigation bar.


Configuring the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the server up and running you can now configure **qpc** to work with the server. You can do this with the ``qpc server config`` command. The ``qpc server config`` command takes a ``--host <host>`` flag and an optional ``--port <port>`` flag; defaults to ``443``. If you are using qpc on the same system where the server is running you can supply ``--host 127.0.0.1`` otherwise supply the correct IP address. If you decided to remap the port to another port you must supply that to the port option (i.e. ``--port 8443``).

Now the command line has been configured you can log in with the ``qpc server login`` command. Verify your ability to log into the server.


Getting Started
---------------
Now that everything is installed and configured you can begin to utilize the capabilities of Quipucords to gather information on your IT infrastructure.

Quipucords inspects various sources using credentials. You must first identify what sources will be inspected from the supported list:

- Network
- vCenter server
- Satellite

Network sources are composed of IP address, IP ranges, or hostnames. vCenter server and Satellite sources are created with the IP address or hostname of the server. Sources additionally are composed of credentials. A Network source can have a list of credentials as it is expected that many may be needed for a broad IP range, whereas vCenter server and Satellite use a single credential.

Working with a Network Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's walk through the various commands needed to use a Network source.

Complete the following steps, repeating them as necessary to access all parts of your environment that you want to scan:

1. Create at least one Network credential with root-level access::

  # qpc cred add --type network --name cred_name --username root_name [--sshkeyfile key_file] [--password]

If you did not use the ``sshkeyfile`` option to provide an SSH key for the username value, enter the password of the user with root-level access at the connection password prompt.

For example, for a Network credential where the name is **roothost1**, the user with root-level access is ``root``, and the SSH key for the user is in the ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` file, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc cred add --type network --name roothost1 --username root --sshkeyfile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

qpc also supports privilege escalation with the ``become-method``, ``become-user``, and ``become-password`` options to create a Network credential for a user to obtain root-level access. You can use the ``become-*`` options with either the ``sshkeyfile`` or the ``password`` option.

For example, for a Network credential where the name is **sudouser1**, the user with root-level access is ``sysadmin``, and the access is obtained through the password option, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc cred add --type network --name sudouser1 --username sysadmin --password --become-password

After you enter this command, you are prompted to enter two passwords. First, you would enter the connection password for the username user, and then you would enter the password for the **become-method** which is the ``sudo`` command by default.

2. Create at least one Network source that specifies one or more network identifiers, such as a host name, an IP address, a list of IP addresses, or an IP range, and one or more network credentials to be used for the scan::

  # qpc source add --type network --name source_name --hosts host_name_or_file --cred cred_name

For example, for a Network source where the name is **mynetwork**, the network to be scanned is the **192.0.2.0/24** subnet, and the Network credentials that are used to run the scan are **roothost1** and **roothost2**, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc source add --type network --name mynetwork --hosts 192.0.2.[1:254] --cred roothost1 roothost2

You can also use a file to pass in the network identifiers. If you use a file to enter multiple network identifiers, such as multiple individual IP addresses, enter each on a single line. For example, for a network profile where the path to this file is /home/user1/hosts_file, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc source add --type network --name mynetwork --hosts /home/user1/hosts_file --cred roothost1 roothost2


Working with a vCenter Server Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's walk through the various commands needed to use a vCenter server source.

Complete the following steps, repeating them as necessary to access all parts of your environment that you want to scan:

1. Create at least one vCenter credential::

  # qpc cred add --type vcenter --name cred_name --username vcenter_user --password

Enter the password of the user with access to the vCenter server at the connection password prompt.

For example, for a vCenter credential where the name is **vcenter_admin** and the user with access is ``admin`` would enter the following command::

  # qpc cred add --type vcenter --name vcenter_admin --username admin --password

2. Create at least one vCenter source that specifies a network identifiers, such as a host name or an IP address of the vCenter server, and one vCenter credential to be used for the scan::

  # qpc source add --type vcenter --name source_name --hosts host_name --cred cred_name

For example, for a vCenter source where the name is **myvcenter**, the vCenter server to be scanned is the **192.0.2.10**, and the vCenter credential used to run the scan is **vcenter_admin**, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc source add --type vcenter --name myvcenter --hosts 192.0.2.10 --cred vcenter_admin


Working with a Satellite Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's walk through the various commands needed to use a Satellite source.

Complete the following steps, repeating them as necessary to access all parts of your environment that you want to scan:

1. Create at least one Satellite credential::

  # qpc cred add --type satellite --name cred_name --username satellite_user --password

Enter the password of the user with access to the Satellite server at the connection password prompt.

For example, for a Satellite credential where the name is **satellite_admin** and the user with access is ``admin`` would enter the following command::

  # qpc cred add --type satellite --name satellite_admin --username admin --password

2. Create at least one Satellite source that specifies a network identifiers, such as a host name or an IP address of the Satellite server, and one Satellite credential to be used for the scan::

  # qpc source add --type satellite --name source_name --hosts host_name --cred cred_name

For example, for a Satellite source where the name is **mysatellite6**, the Satellite server to be scanned is the **192.0.2.15**, and the Satellite credential used to run the scan is **satellite_admin**, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc source add --type satellite --name mysatellite6 --hosts 192.0.2.15 --cred satellite_admin


Running a scan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After you set up your credentials and sources, you can run a Quipucords scan.

Run the scan by using the ``scan start`` command, specifying one or more sources for the ``sources`` option::

  # qpc scan --sources source_name1 source_name2

For example, if you want to use the Network source **mynetwork** and the Satellite source **mysatellite6**, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc scan start --sources mynetwork mysatellite6

After executing the command you will be provided an identifier for the scan that is being run. You can follow the status of the scan by using the ``scan show`` command, specifying the provided identifier.

For example, if the ``scan start`` provided the following output::

  # qpc scan start --sources mynetwork mysatellite6
  Scan "1" started

To follow the status of the scan you would enter the following command::

  # qpc scan show --id 1

When the scan completes you can obtain the report by using the ``report summary`` command and specifying the identifier for the scan along with the desired format **JSON** or **CSV** and the ``output-file``.

For example, if you wanted to see the report summary for a scan with identifier **1** as a CSV file stored in ~/scan_result.csv, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc report summary --id 1 --csv --output-file=~/scan_result.CSV

The ``report summary`` command produces a report that has attempted to deduplicate and merge facts from hosts found from multiple sources. If you wish to see the raw facts used to create this report you can use the ``report detail`` command which takes the same options as the ``report summary`` command but with output from each source.
