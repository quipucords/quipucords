Quipucords User Guide
=====================

This version of the *Quipucords User Guide* is provided as a preview during the pilot phase of Project Sonar. This guide is under development and is subject to substantial change. Because one of the goals of the pilot phase is to gather feedback on the documentation and workflows, you are encouraged to provide feedback about potential improvements to this information. Submit your feedback to the Project Sonar support contact email address, <sonar-pilot@redhat.com>.

About Quipucords
----------------
Quipucords, accessed through the ``qpc`` command, is an inspection and reporting tool. It is designed to identify and report environment data, or *facts*, such as the number of physical and virtual systems on a network, their operating systems, and other configuration data. In addition, it is designed to identify and report more detailed facts for some versions of key Red Hat packages and products for the Linux based IT resources in that network.

The ability to inspect the software and systems that are running on your network improves your ability to understand and report on your entitlement usage. Ultimately, this inspection and reporting process is part of the larger system administration task of managing your inventories.

Quipucords requires two types of data to access IT resources and run the inspection process. A *credential* defines user information such as the user name and password or SSH key of the user that runs the inspection process. A *source* defines the entity to be inspected, such as a host, subnet, network, or systems management solution such as vCenter Server or Red Hat Satellite, plus includes one or more credentials to use to access that network or systems management solution during the inspection process. You can save multiple credentials and sources to use with Quipucords in various combinations as you run inspection processes, or *scans*. When you have completed a scan, you can access the output as a *report* to review the results.

Requirements
------------
Before installing Quipucords in your environment, review the following guidelines about installing and running Quipucords:

- You must install Quipucords on a system that is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7.
- The system that Quipucords is installed on must have access to the systems to be discovered and inspected.
- The systems that are targeted for the inspection process must be running SSH.
- The user account that Quipucords uses for the SSH connection into the target systems, otherwise known as the credential, must have adequate permissions to run commands and read certain files, such as privilege escalation required for the ``systemctl`` command.
- The credential user account requires an sh shell or a similar shell. For example, the shell *cannot* be a /sbin/nologin or /bin/false shell.

Installing Quipucords
---------------------
Quipucords is delivered in two parts, a command line tool as an RPM package and a server as a container image. The following instructions describe how to install the parts of Quipucords.

Installing the Quipucords Command Line Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
qpc, the command line tool that is installed by RPM, is available for `download <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/chambridge/qpc/>`_ from the Fedora COPR build and repository system.

    # yum -y install qpc-0.0.1-1.git.342.44b5e58.el6

Installing the Quipucords Server Requirement and Container Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Quipucords server is delivered as a container image that runs on your server. First you must install and start the necessary prerequisite, Docker, to run the container. Then you can obtain and install the Quipucords server container image.

Installing the Docker Prerequisite
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The instructions for installing Docker vary according to your system configuration.

Installing Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can install Docker in different ways, depending on your needs:

- You can set up the Docker repositories and then install from them. This choice is the recommended approach because it simplifies the installation and upgrade tasks.

- You can download the RPM package, install it manually, and manage upgrades manually. This choice is useful when Docker is installed on systems with limited or no access to the internet.

Installing from the repository
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Make sure that you are logged in as a user with ``sudo`` or ``root`` privileges.

2. Install the required packages::

  # sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

3. Add the repository::

  # sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

4. Install Docker from the repository::

  # sudo yum install docker-ce

Installing from a package
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/. For the Docker version that you want to install, download the RPM package to the intended installation system.

2. Make sure that you are logged in as a user with ``sudo`` or ``root`` privileges.

3. Install Docker, changing the path in the following example to the path where you downloaded the Docker package::

 # sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm

Starting Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
After you install Docker, you must start it and verify that it is running.

1. Start Docker::

  # sudo systemctl start docker

2. Verify that Docker is installed correctly. To do this step, run the hello-world image::

  # sudo docker run hello-world

After you complete the steps to install Docker for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or later, continue with the Quipucords server installation steps in `Installing the Quipucords Server Container Image`_.

Installing Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 or later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 or later, you must have kernel 2.6.32-431 or later installed.

To check the current kernel release, open a terminal session and use the ``uname`` command to display the kernel release information, as shown in the following example::

  # uname -r

The output of this command is similar to the following example::

  2.6.32-573.el6.x86_64

**TIP:** After you confirm that you have at least the minimum required kernel release, it is recommended that you fully update your system. Having a fully patched system can help you avoid kernel bugs that have already been fixed on the latest kernel packages.

When your system meets the minimum required kernel release, you can use the following steps to install Docker:

1. Make sure that you are logged in as a user with ``sudo`` or ``root`` privileges.

2. Download the Docker RPM package to the current directory::

  # curl -k -O -sSL https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/6/Packages/docker-engine-1.7.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

3. Install the Docker package with yum::

  # sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck docker-engine-1.7.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm


Starting Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 or later
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
After you install Docker, you must start it and verify that it is running.

1. Start the Docker daemon::

  # sudo service docker start

2. Verify that Docker is installed correctly. To do this step, run the hello-world image::

  # sudo docker run hello-world

This command displays output similar to the following truncated example. The first section of the output contains a message about the installation status::

  Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
  latest: Pulling from hello-world
  a8219747be10: Pull complete
  91c95931e552: Already exists
  hello-world:latest: The image you are pulling has been verified. Important: image verification is a tech preview feature and should not be relied on to provide security.
  Digest: sha256:aa03e5d0d5553b4c3473e89c8619cf79df368babd18681cf5daeb82aab55838d
  Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
  Hello from Docker.
  This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

  ...


3. To ensure that Docker starts when you start your system, enter the following command::

  # sudo chkconfig docker on

After you complete the steps to install Docker for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 or later, continue with the Quipucords server installation steps in `Installing the Quipucords Server Container Image`_.

Installing the Quipucords Server Container Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After Docker is installed, you can obtain and install the container image that enables the use of the Quipucords server.

1. Download the server container image by entering the following command::

    #  curl -k -O -sSL https://ftp.redhat.com/repo/container/quipucords.pilot.tar.gz

2. Load the container image into the local Docker registry by entering the following command:

  ::

    #  sudo docker load -i quipucords.pilot.tar.gz

  The output appears similar to the following example::

   Loaded image: quipucords:pilot


3. Verify the image within the local Docker registry by entering the following command:

  ::

   #  sudo docker images

  The output appears similar to the following example::

   REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   quipucords              pilot               fdadcc4b326f        3 days ago          969MB


Configuring and Starting Quipucords
-----------------------------------
After you install the Quipucords server container image in the image registry, you must select configuration options to be used at the time that you start the server and the command line tool. When you are sure of the options that you want to use, you can start Quipucords by starting the server and the command line tool.

Selecting the Quipucords Server Configuration Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you run the command to start the Quipucords server, you supply values for several options that affect the configuration of that server. You must make the following decisions:

- Accepting or changing the default exposed server port
- Selecting a directory for SSH keys
- Selecting a directory for the SQLlite database
- Selecting a directory for log output

The following steps guide you through those choices.

1. Accept or change the default exposed server port to use for HTTPS communication. By default, the server exposes port 443, which is the standard HTTPS port. You can choose to use that port or remap the port to be used on your server.

   - If you select to expose port 443, you would use the following option when you run the Docker command to start the server: ``-p 443:443``.
   - If you want to remap the port on your system, you would supply a new value for the port when you run the Docker command to start the server. The syntax of this option is  ``-p <host_port>:<container_port>``. For example, to remap the port to ``8443``, you would enter the following option in the command: ``-p 8443:443``. Additionally, Docker supplies an option to select a free port for all exposed ports by using the ``-P`` option; the port mapping is then available from the ``sudo docker ps`` command.

2. Select values for the directory for SSH keys, the directory for the SQLlite database, and the directory for the log output. The most efficient way to configure these options is to create a home directory for the Quipucords server and then use that home directory for each of these three options.

   \a. Create the home directory. The following example command creates the home directory  ``~/quipucords``::

    # mkdir -p ~/quipucords

   \b. Change to that home directory. For example::

    # cd ~/quipucords

   \c. Create subdirectories to house the SSH keys, (``~/quipucords/sshkeys``), database (``~/quipucords/data``), and log output (``~/quipucords/log``). For example::

       # mkdir sshkeys
       # mkdir data
       # mkdir log

Starting the Quipucords Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After you make the decisions on the configuration options for the server, you can start the Quipucords server. The following commands assume that you used the default port and the recommended steps to create a home directory and subdirectories for the SSH keys, SQLlite database, and log output during the Quipucords server configuration.

If your system does not have SELinux enabled, you can start the Quipucords server with the following Docker command::

  # sudo docker run --name quipucords -d -p 443:443 -v ~/quipucords/sshkeys:/sshkeys -v ~/quipucords/data:/var/data -v ~/quipucords/log:/var/log -i quipucords:pilot

If your system does have SELinux enabled, you must append ``:z`` to each volume as follows::

  # sudo docker run --name quipucords -d -p 443:443 -v ~/quipucords/sshkeys:/sshkeys:z -v ~/quipucords/data:/var/data:z -v ~/quipucords/log:/var/log:z -i quipucords:pilot

These commands start the server on port ``443`` and map the ``sshkeys``, ``data``, and ``log`` directories to the ``~/quipucords`` home directory for the server.

To view the status of the server after it is running, enter the following command::

  # sudo docker ps

Changing the Default Password for the Quipucords Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Quipucords server has a default administrator user with a default user name of ``admin`` and a default password of ``pass``. To ensure the security of your Quipucords server, it is recommended that you change the default password to a different password.

To change the default password for the Quipucords server, use the following steps:

1. In a browser window, enter the URL to the Quipucords server. When you enter the URL to the Quipucords server, the browser loads a web page that shows an administrative login dialog box.

   - If the browser window is running on the same system as the server and you used the default port of ``443`` for the server, the URL is ``https://localhost/admin``.
   - If the browser window is running on a remote system, or if it is on the same system but you changed the default HTTPS port, enter the URL in the following format: ``https://ip_address:port/admin``. For example, if the IP address for the server is 192.0.2.0 and the port is remapped to ``8443``, you would enter ``https://192.0.2.0:8443/admin`` in the browser window.

2. In the resulting web page that contains the Quipucords administrative login dialog box, enter the default user name ``admin`` and the default password ``pass`` to log in to the Quipucords server.

3. Click **Change password** to enter a new password for the Quipucords server. Record the new password in an enterprise password management solution or other password management tool, as determined by the best practices for your organization.

**TIP:** You can also enter the local or remote URL (as applicable) for the Quipucords server in a browser window to verify that the Quipucords server is responding.

Configuring the qpc Command Line Tool Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the Quipucords server is running, you can configure the qpc command line tool to work with the server. The ``qpc server config`` command configures the connection between the qpc command line tool and the Quipucords server.

The ``qpc server config`` command takes the following options:

- The ``--host`` option is required. If you are using the qpc command line tool on the same system where the server is running, you can supply the loopback address ``127.0.0.1`` as the value. Otherwise, supply the IP address for your Quipucords server.
- The ``--port`` option is optional. The default value for this option is ``443``. If you decided to remap the Quipucords default exposed server port to another port, the port option is required. You must supply the port option and the remapped value in the command, for example, ``--port 8443``.

For example, if you are configuring the command line tool on the same system as the server and the server uses the default exposed server port, you would enter the following command to configure the qpc command line tool::

  # qpc server config --host 127.0.0.1

However, if you are configuring the command line tool on a system that is remote from the server, the Quipucords server is running on the IP address 192.0.2.0, and the port is remapped to 8443, you would enter the following command to configure the qpc command line tool::

  # qpc server config --host 192.0.2.0 --port 8443

Logging in to the Quipucords Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the connection between the qpc command line tool and the Quipucords server is configured on the system where you want to use the command line interface, you can log in to the server and begin using the command line interface to run qpc commands.

1. To log in to the server, enter the following command::

  # qpc server login

2. Enter the server user name and password at the prompts.

The ``qpc server login`` command retrieves a token that is used for authentication with subsequent command line interface commands. That token is removed when you log out of the server, and expires daily.

Getting Started with Quipucords
-------------------------------
You use the capabilities of Quipucords to inspect and gather information on your IT infrastructure. The following information describes how you use the qpc command line interface to complete common Quipucords tasks. The complete list of options for each qpc command and subcommand are listed in the qpc man page.

Quipucords requires the configuration of two basic structures to manage the inspection process. A *credential* contains the access credentials, such as the user name and password or SSH key of the user, with sufficient authority to run the inspection process on a particular source. For more information about this authority, see `Requirements`_. A *source* defines the entity or entities to be inspected, such as a host, subnet, network, or systems management solution such as vCenter Server or Satellite. When you create a source, you also include one or more of the configured credentials to use to access the individual entities in the source during the inspection process.

You can save multiple credentials and sources to use with Quipucords in various combinations as you run inspection processes, or *scans*. When you have completed a scan, you can access the collection of *facts* in the output as a *report* to review the results.

Before You Begin: Check the Connection to the Quipucords Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In some organizations, a single person might be responsible for scanning IT resources. However, in others, multiple people might hold this responsibility. Any additional Quipucords users who did not install the Quipucords server and command line tool must ensure that the command line tool instance is configured to connect to the server and that the user name can log in to the command line interface.

For more information, see the following sections:

- `Configuring the qpc Command Line Tool Connection`_
- `Logging in to the Quipucords Server`_

Creating Credentials and Sources for the Different Source Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The type of source that you are going to inspect determines the type of data that is required for credential and source configuration. Quipucords currently supports the following source types in the source creation command:

- network
- vcenter
- satellite

A *network* source is composed of one or more host names, one or more IP addresses, IP ranges, or a combination of these network resources. A *vcenter*, for vCenter Server, or *satellite*, for Satellite, source is created with the IP address or host name of that system management solution server.

In addition, the source creation command references one or more credentials. Typically, a network source might include multiple credentials because it is expected that many credentials would be needed to access a broad IP range. Conversely, a vcenter or satellite source would typically use a single credential to access a particular system management solution server.

The following scenarios provide examples of how you would create a network, vcenter, or satellite source and create the credentials required for each.

Creating a Network Source
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
To create a network source, use the following steps:

1. Create at least one network credential with root-level access:

   ::

    # qpc cred add --type network --name cred_name --username root_name [--sshkeyfile key_file] [--password]

   If you did not use the ``sshkeyfile`` option to provide an SSH key for the user name value, enter the password of the user with root-level access at the connection password prompt.

   If you want to use SSH keyfiles in the credential, you must copy the keys into the directory that you mapped to ``/sshkeys`` during Quipucords server configuration. In the example information for that procedure, that directory is ``~/quipucords/sshkeys``. The server references these files locally, so refer to the keys as if they are in the ``/sshkeys`` directory from the qpc command.

   For example, for a network credential where the ``/sshkeys`` directory for the server is mapped to ``~/quipucords/sshkeys``, the credential name is ``roothost1``, the user with root-level access is ``root``, and the SSH key for the user is in the ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` file, you would enter the following commands:

   ::

    # cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/quipucords/sshkeys
    # qpc cred add --type network --name roothost1 --username root --sshkeyfile /sshkeys/id_rsa

   Privilege escalation with the ``become-method``, ``become-user``, and ``become-password`` options is also supported to create a network credential for a user to obtain root-level access. You can use the ``become-*`` options with either the ``sshkeyfile`` or the ``password`` option.

   For example, for a network credential where the credential name is ``sudouser1``, the user with root-level access is ``sysadmin``, and the access is obtained through the password option, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc cred add --type network --name sudouser1 --username sysadmin --password --become-password

   After you enter this command, you are prompted to enter two passwords. First, you would enter the connection password for the ``username`` user, and then you would enter the password for the ``become-method``, which is the ``sudo`` command by default.

2. Create at least one network source that specifies one or more network identifiers, such as a host name or host names, an IP address, a list of IP addresses, or an IP range, and one or more network credentials to be used for the scan.

   **TIP:** You can provide IP range values in CIDR or Ansible notation.

   ::

    # qpc source add --type network --name source_name --hosts host_name_or_file --cred cred_name

   For example, for a network source where the source name is ``mynetwork``, the network to be scanned is the ``192.0.2.0/24`` subnet, and the network credentials that are used to run the scan are ``roothost1`` and ``roothost2``, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc source add --type network --name mynetwork --hosts 192.0.2.[1:254] --cred roothost1 roothost2

   You can also use a file to pass in the network identifiers. If you use a file to enter multiple network identifiers, such as multiple individual IP addresses, enter each on a single line. For example, for a network profile where the path to this file is ``/home/user1/hosts_file``, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc source add --type network --name mynetwork --hosts /home/user1/hosts_file --cred roothost1 roothost2


Creating a vCenter Source
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
To create a vcenter source, use the following steps:

1. Create at least one vcenter credential:

   ::

    # qpc cred add --type vcenter --name cred_name --username vcenter_user --password

   Enter the password of the user with access to vCenter Server at the connection password prompt.

   For example, for a vcenter credential where the credential name is ``vcenter_admin`` and the user with access to the vCenter Server server is ``admin``, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc cred add --type vcenter --name vcenter_admin --username admin --password

2. Create at least one vcenter source that specifies the host name or IP address of the server for vCenter Server and one vcenter credential to be used for the scan:

   ::

    # qpc source add --type vcenter --name source_name --hosts host_name --cred cred_name

   For example, for a vcenter source where the source name is ``myvcenter``, the server for the vCenter Server is located at the ``192.0.2.10`` IP address, and the vcenter credential for that server is ``vcenter_admin``, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc source add --type vcenter --name myvcenter --hosts 192.0.2.10 --cred vcenter_admin

   **IMPORTANT:** By default, sources are scanned with full SSL validation, but you might need to adjust the level of SSL validation to connect properly to the server for vCenter Server. The ``source add`` command supports options that are commonly used to downgrade the SSL validation. The ``--ssl-cert-verify`` option can take a value of ``False`` to disable SSL certificate validation; this option would be used for any server with a self-signed certificate. The ``--disable-ssl`` option can take a value of ``True`` to connect to the server over standard HTTP.

Creating a Satellite Source
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To create a satellite source, use the following steps:

1. Create at least one satellite credential:

   ::

     # qpc cred add --type satellite --name cred_name --username satellite_user --password

   Enter the password of the user with access to the Satellite server at the connection password prompt.

   For example, for a satellite credential where the credential name is ``satellite_admin`` and the user with access is to the Satellite server is ``admin``, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc cred add --type satellite --name satellite_admin --username admin --password

2. Create at least one satellite source that specifies the host name or IP address of the Satellite server, one satellite credential to be used for the scan, and the version of the Satellite server (supported version values are ``6.2``, ``6.3``):

   ::

    # qpc source add --type satellite --name source_name --hosts host_name --cred cred_name --satellite-version sat_ver

   For example, for a satellite source where the source name is ``mysatellite6``, the Satellite server is located at the ``192.0.2.15`` IP address, the satellite credential for that server is ``satellite_admin``, and the version of the Satellite server is ``6.2``, you would enter the following command:

   ::

    # qpc source add --type satellite --name mysatellite6 --hosts 192.0.2.15 --cred satellite_admin --satellite-version 6.2

   **IMPORTANT:** By default, sources are scanned with full SSL validation, but you might need to adjust the level of SSL validation to connect properly to the Satellite server. The ``source add`` command supports options that are commonly used to downgrade the SSL validation. The ``--ssl-cert-verify`` option can take a value of ``False`` to disable SSL certificate validation; this option would be used for any server with a self-signed certificate. The Satellite server does not support disabling SSL, so the ``--disable-ssl`` option has no effect.

Running a Scan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After you set up your credentials and sources, you can run a Quipucords scan to inspect your IT environment. You can run a scan on a single source or combine sources, even sources of different types.

**IMPORTANT:** Scans run consecutively on the Quipucords server, in the order in which the ``qpc scan start`` command for each scan is entered.

To run a scan, use the following steps:

Run the scan by using the ``scan start`` command, specifying one or more sources for the ``sources`` option::

  # qpc scan start --sources source_name1 source_name2

For example, if you want to scan the network source ``mynetwork`` and the satellite source ``mysatellite6``, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc scan start --sources mynetwork mysatellite6

Showing Scan Results for an Active Scan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you run the ``scan start`` command, the output provides an identifier for that scan. You can show the scan results to follow the status of the scan by using the ``scan show`` command and specifying the provided identifier.

**IMPORTANT:** The ``scan show`` command can show results only after the scan starts running. You can also use this command on a scan that is completed.

For example, you could run the following scan as the first scan in your environment::

  # qpc scan start --sources mynetwork mysatellite6

The output for the command shows the following information, with ``1`` listed as the scan identifier::

  Scan "1" started

To show the scan results to follow the status of that scan, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc scan show --id 1

Listing Scan Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to showing the status of a single scan, you can also show a list of all scans that are in progress or are completed on the Quipucords server. To show this list of scans, you use the ``scan list`` command. The output of this command includes the scan identifier, the source or sources for that scan, and the current state of the scan.

To show the list of scans, enter the following command::

  # qpc scan list

Viewing the Scan Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When the scan completes, you have the capability to produce a report for that scan. You can request a report with all the details, or facts, of the scan, or request a report with a summary. The summary report process runs steps to merge the facts found during the inspection of the various hosts that are contacted during the scan. When possible, the report process also runs steps to deduplicate redundant systems. For both types of reports, you can produce the report in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format or comma-separated values (CSV) format.

To generate a summary report, enter the ``report summary`` command and specify the identifier for the scan and the format for the output file.

For example, if you want to create the report summary for a scan with the scan identifier of ``1`` and you want to generate that report in CSV format in the ``~/scan_result.csv`` file, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc report summary --id 1 --csv --output-file=~/scan_result.csv

However, if you want to create the detailed report, you would use the ``report detail`` command.  This command takes the same options as the ``report summary`` command. The output is not deduplicated and merged, so it contains all facts from each source. For example, to create the detailed report for a scan with the scan identifier ``1``, with CSV output in the ``~/scan_result.csv`` file, you would enter the following command::

  # qpc report detail --id 1 --csv --output-file=~/scan_result.csv

Pausing and Restarting a Scan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you use Quipucords, you might need to stop a currently running scan. There might be various business reasons that require you to do this, for example, the need to do an emergency fix due to an alert from your IT health monitoring system or the need to run a higher priority scan if a lower priority scan is currently running.

When you stop a scan by using the ``scan pause`` command, you can restart that same scan by using the ``scan restart`` command. To pause and restart a scan, use the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have the scan identifier for the currently running scan. To obtain the scan identifier, see the information in `Showing Scan Results for an Active Scan`_.

2. Enter the command to pause the scan. For example, if the scan identifier is ``1``, you would enter the following command::

    # qpc scan pause --id 1

3. When you are ready to start the scan again, enter the command to restart the scan. For example, to restart scan ``1``, you would enter the following command::

    # qpc scan restart --id 1

Logging out of the Quipucords Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you log in to the server, the command retrieves a token that is used for authentication with subsequent command line interface commands. That token expires daily. In addition, the token is removed when you log out of the server.

To log out of the server, enter the following command::

  # qpc server logout

Contacting Project Sonar Pilot Support
--------------------------------------
The Project Sonar team relies on your feedback during this pilot to improve the quality and usability of Quipucords. For issues, questions, and suggestions for improvements that are related to the Project Sonar pilot, contact the pilot support team at <sonar-pilot@redhat.com>.

When you contact the pilot support team about an issue that you encounter while using Quipucords, you might then be asked to provide certain information that can help to resolve that issue. This information might include IT environment information such as the operating system and version for the machine or machines that are running the Quipucords server and command line interface, information about Quipucords usage such as the task that you are trying to perform and the detailed scan report of the scan that was running as you encountered the issue (if applicable), or Quipucords log information, among other requests.

To provide the detailed report for a scan, follow the steps in `Viewing the Scan Report`_ to generate that report.

To provide log information, access the log file locations for the Quipucords server and command line interface. If you followed the recommended Quipucords server configuration options in `Selecting the Quipucords Server Configuration Options`_, the server log files are located in the path ``~/quipucords/log``. The command line interface log file is ``~/.local/share/qpc/qpc.log``.

After you generate the information that is required to assist with problem resolution, submit the information to the pilot support team according to the instructions that they provide.
