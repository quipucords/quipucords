.. _logout:

Logging out of the Quipucords Server
------------------------------------

When you log in to the server, the command retrieves a token that is used for authentication with subsequent command line interface commands. That token expires daily. In addition, the token is removed when you log out of the server.

To log out of the server, enter the following command::

  # qpc server logout
