Connecting to the Server with the Command Line Interface
========================================================

If you chose to complete the step-by-step installation, you must configure a connection between the Quipucords server and the command line tool from each machine where you plan to use the command line interface. If you chose the scripted install, one connection to the server is configured for you on the same machine where the server is installed, but you must configure any additional connections, for example, on a machine that is remote from the server machine.

After you configure the connection between the server and the command line tool, you can use the command line interface to connect to the Quipcords server. After you are logged in, you can begin using Quipucords to set up and run scans on your IT infrastructure.
