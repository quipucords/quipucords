About Quipucords
````````````````
Quipucords is a *Python* based information gathering tool. Quipucords is an
inspection and reporting tool to identify environment data, or *facts*,
such as the number of physical and virtual systems on a network, their
operating systems and other configuration data, and versions of some key
packages and products for almost any Linux or UNIX version. The ability to
inspect the software and systems that are running on your network improves your
ability to understand and report on your entitlement usage. Ultimately,
this inspection and reporting process is part of the larger system
administration task of managing your inventories.
