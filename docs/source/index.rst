About Quipucords
````````````````
Quipucords is a *Python* based information gathering tool that is accessed through the ``qpc`` command and its subcommands. It enables the reporting of IT resource data based on the inspection of  network or system management solution resources. Quipucords identifies environment data, or *facts*, such as the number of physical and virtual systems on a network, their operating systems, and other configuration data. In addition, it is designed to identify and report more detailed facts for some versions of key Red Hat packages and products for the Linux based IT resources in that network.

The ability to inspect the software and systems that are running on your network improves your ability to understand and report on your entitlement usage. Ultimately, this inspection and reporting process is part of the larger system administration task of managing your inventories.
