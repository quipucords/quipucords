    Get data nested inside a dictionary and or list that came from a json.

    To get a nested data use __ as a "lookup" separator.
    If the data can't be found, `None` is returned.

    Example usage
    =============
    >>> data = {"foo": {"bar": "bla", "some_list": ["foo", "bar"]}}
    >>> assert deepget(data, "foo__bar") == "bla"
    >>> assert deepget(data, "foo__bar__some_list__0") == "foo"

    Notes and limitations
    =====================
    - Keys containing "__" will be ignored
    - Dict-like objects: only strings are supported as keys (since this function was
      designed to access data parsed from json)
    - List-like objects: indexes are expected to be integers
    - set: sets are unsupported
